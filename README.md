# arm-asl-server 

A rudimentary language server to give VS Code better support to deal with ARM64's Architecture Specification Language. For more information on ASL, see [https://alastairreid.github.io/specification_languages/](here). 

## Features

Currently, syntax highlighting. Thanks to a [https://github.com/ARM-software/asl-interpreter](pre-existing interpreter) for ASL code, future features shouldn't be too hard.

# Changelog

### 0.0.1
- Basic syntax highlighting.
