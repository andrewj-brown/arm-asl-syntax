# arm-asl-server 

A rudimentary language server to give VS Code better support to deal with ARM64's Architecture Specification Language. For more information on ASL, see [here](https://alastairreid.github.io/specification_languages/). 

## Features

Currently, basic syntax highlighting. Thanks to a [pre-existing interpreter](https://github.com/ARM-software/asl-interpreter) for ASL code, future features shouldn't be too hard.

## Changelog

#### 0.0.2
- More syntax highlighting to match ASLi's lexer.mll file
#### 0.0.1
- Basic syntax highlighting.
